#### What is Smart Contract
```
    Cosmwasm is nothing but just a standard to write smart contracts so that's Terra understands

    basically smart contracts on Terra are based on wasm and cosmwasm is like one of the standards you can say uses rust to create smart contracts and then 
compile them to wasm binaries but there are many languages and many other frameworks which can be used but as of now Terra is mostly based on Cosmwasm


    Smart contracts are logic which can be used to change the state of a Blockchain. In Blockchain you can't change the data once it is included but if you want
to change it you need to follow some rules or logic and that's where smart contracts are used. To change the state of the blockchain

    So transactions are calls made to the blockchain or we can say to a smart contract to change the state of the blockchain

    If your balance is x and i made a transaction and send you 10 then your balance would be x+10 and that's change of state
